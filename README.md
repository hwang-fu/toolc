# Tool Kit in C

Tool Kit in C is a collection of lightweight, modular, and production-ready C libraries designed to simplify common low-level tasks such as memory management, results handling, containers, and colored terminal output.
Each module is implemented as a standalone static library, allowing you to include only what you need while keeping your project clean and maintainable.

---

## Building the Libraries

Clone the repository and run:

```sh
make
```

This will:

- Build all static libraries into `lib/`
- Copy all public headers into `include/`

---

## Running Tests

To execute all test cases:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

Each module comes with clear and isolated test files.

## Included Libraries

### 1. **libcrayon**
Provides easy and portable ANSI color output for terminals.

**Highlights:**
- Predefined color macros
- Helpers for formatting and styling
- Works across most POSIX terminals

---

### 2. **libmemory**
Safe and convenient wrappers around memory operations.

**Highlights:**
- Safe allocation / reallocation functions
- Automatic `NULL` checks
- Unified `dispose` helpers
- Reduces common memory misuse bugs

---

### 3. **libresult**
A lightweight `Result` structure to express success/failure without relying on global state or exceptions.

**Highlights:**
- `Result` type with status + optional error info
- Consistent error handling API
- Makes function return-paths explicit and predictable

---

### 4. **libpair**
Generic pair data structure for storing two related values.

**Highlights:**
- Stores value or reference types
- Supports pairs of *heterogeneous* types
- Offers clean creation, accessors, and disposal mechanisms

---

### 5. **libassertion**
Runtime assertion utilities.

**Highlights:**
- Custom, human-readable assert messages
- Safer program checks with controlled termination
- Helpful for debugging and runtime validation

---

### 6. **libdequeue**
A double-ended queue (deque) optimized for fast push/pop from both ends.

**Highlights:**
- Stores uniform element types
- Supports value or reference storage
- Automatic cleanup of stored elements at disposal
- Ideal for FIFO, LIFO, and sliding-window patterns

---

### 7. **libvector**
A dynamic vector that supports storing **multiple types in the same container**.

**Highlights:**
- Flexible mixed-type storage
- Proper disposal for every inserted element
- Automatically grows as needed
- Great for heterogeneous collections

---

### 8. **libhashmap**
A simple, efficient string-keyed hashmap.

**Highlights:**
- Keys are C-strings (internally copied or referenced depending on API)
- All values inside one hashmap must share the same type
- Automatic cleanup of keys + values on disposal
- Ideal for lookup tables and keyed storage
